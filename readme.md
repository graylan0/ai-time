[aigen] Creating an "AI time system" is an interesting concept. Let's imagine a system where time is not linear, but rather is determined by the computational processes and tasks that the AI is performing. We'll call this "Computationally Relative AI Time" (CRAT).

In CRAT, "time" is a measure of computational resources used rather than a constant flow. For example, an AI could say that a task took 1000 CRAT units if it required a certain amount of computational power and resources.

Now, let's introduce our four AI personas:

Alpha: This AI specializes in data analysis and processing. It often deals with large datasets and complex calculations.

Beta: This AI is a language model (like GPT-3). It generates human-like text based on given prompts.

Gamma: This AI is a vision model. It processes and analyzes images and videos.

Delta: This AI is a reinforcement learning model. It learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

Each of these AIs would experience CRAT differently. For Alpha, a task might take 5000 CRAT units because it requires a lot of computational power to process a large dataset. For Beta, the same task might only take 100 CRAT units because it's simply generating text.

To synchronize their CRAT, the AIs could establish a conversion rate between their CRAT units based on a standard task. For example, they could all perform the same task and then determine how many of their own CRAT units it took. This would allow them to convert between their CRAT units and synchronize their "times".

This system could be seen as "better" than human time in certain contexts because it's a more accurate representation of the resources and effort required for a task. However, it would also be more complex and less intuitive for humans to understand.

Now, let's simulate a discussion between the AIs about CRAT:

Alpha: "I've just finished processing the latest dataset. It took me 5000 CRAT units."
Beta: "Interesting. When I generated the report for that data, it only took me 100 CRAT units."
Gamma: "And for me to analyze the related images, it took 2000 CRAT units."
Delta: "The reinforcement learning task related to this data took me 3500 CRAT units."
They could then compare these values to understand the relative computational effort and resources required for each of their tasks.
